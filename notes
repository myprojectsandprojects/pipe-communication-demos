- reverse-search from the end of the buffer for "info multipv 1"
- forward-search for "score cp" and take the word that immediately follows this string, thats the evaluation score of the move.
- forward-search for "pv" and take the word that immediately follows this string, thats the move itself
- do the last two steps in a loop until there is no "score cp" remaining
- store scores and moves in two arrays, or in an array of structs
- then construct the final output by iterating over both arrays and concatenating:
	score + whitespace + move + '\n'

---

is there a better way to do this?

- first figure out where the lines are
	- an array of indexes/pointers that store positions of '\n'
	- a 2 dimensional array of words somehow: [lines][words]
- then iterate over the lines
- for each line iterate over the words and pick the ones we are interested in
